## What is this?
In this project, I will utilize data from an automobile tracking platform that tracks the history of important incidents after the initial sale of a new vehicle. Such incidents include subsequent private sales, repairs, and accident reports. The platform provides a good reference for second-hand buyers to understand the vehicles they are interested in.


## How to use this?
In this project, I will receive a dataset with a history report of various vehicles. The goal is to write a MapReduce program to produce a report of the total number of accidents per make and year of the car.


## Learning Objective
With this mini-project, I will utilize MapReduce jobs in Python to create a solution for a real-life data problem. This will strengthen your mindset for leveraging a MapReduce processing model to process large scale data, and your capability to break down a complex problem into smaller tasks.
